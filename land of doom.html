<section id="reveues"><p>here is some reveues from some travelers </p>
  <ul>
    <li class = "font-weight"><b><i>4</i></b> out of <b><i>5</i></b> stars: We really enjoyed our trip, and enjoyed all the activities, Johnny got lost. We never found him again, but over-all, the experience was amazing!<br>- <i>James Walker</i></li>
    
    <li class = "font-weight"><b><i>5</i></b> out of <b><i>5</i></b> stars: i w3nt 2 th3 <b class = "land-of-doom">Land of regrets</b> 4 our 5th grad3 class fi3ld trip. It was r3ally fun. Dave (th3 class bully) push3d Lily Heather to th3 Zombi3 hord. W3 also w3nt 2 <i>The Lava Cafe</i> and Dave and i dar3d 3ach oth3r to ord3r th3 mushrooms. He died (b3caus3 his w3r3 poisonous), but at l3ast I got th3 rid3 hom3 half-off! Ha! Ha! XD<br>- <i>Billy Jon3s</i></li>
    <li class = "font-weight"><b><i>2</i></b> out of <b><i>5</i></b> stars: We went to <b class = "land-of-doom">The Land of regrets</b> because our eight-year-old son, Josh, saw it in a magizine, and wanted to go. We really liked the experience. My husband, who's a alienist, (a person who studies aliens), was so thrilled to see an alien. I was thrilled as well, until he shot one of them by mistake :D. Not only did we have to pay $1,000 to go to this place, but we also had to pay for my husbands hospital bill. At least he can brag about coming in contact with an alien or something like that to his fellow alienist >:D<br>- <i>Mary Clyde</i></li>
    
    <li class = "font-weight"><b><i>4.75</i></b> out of <b><i>5</i></b> stars:  This trip was awesome! I almost got killed by zombies, but that just makes it better! And then I had to use a shrink ray to avoid being eaten by Zombies. The viampiers cornered me, but I used a teleporter to get to the top of <i>a ufo</i>... and then fell off. The skydiving was amazing! Sure, I only survived because of my jetpack, but otherwise, it was great. The one minus was the tomatoes. I dislike tomatoes. But I was too busy running away from a cloud of aliens to order anything.<br>- <i>The Non-pirate</i></li>
    <li class = "font-weight"><b><i>100</i></b>out of<b><i>5</i></b>stars: it was very engoyable i made frends with the aliens and helped them with a plaque in their home planet and gave me some of their advansed technology (which was teleportaton gun,shrink ray,invisibility suitand a jet with hiperjump and a security pass whith is my D.N.A)then i got to nuke bilions of zombies and make a new univers in a random bottle <br><i>kolavon 3</i></br></li>
